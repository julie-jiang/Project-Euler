# Project-Euler
These are my code and solutions to the Project Euler (https://projecteuler.net) problems written in python. 
If you run each python file, the solution to that problem will be printed out. 
FAQ From the Project Euler website:
What is Project Euler?

Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.
