# Project-Euler
These are my code and solutions to the [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net) problems written in python. 
If you run each python file, the solution to that problem will be printed out. 

The solution to each problem will be printed out if the corresponding Python script is executed. 

## What is Project Euler
Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.
