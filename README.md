# Project-Euler
These are my codes and solutions to the [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net) problems written in python. 

The solution to each problem will be printed out if the corresponding Python script is executed. 

## What is Project Euler?
Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.
